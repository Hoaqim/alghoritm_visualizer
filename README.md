# Alghoritm Visualizer
It's an app where you can see how different alghoritms work and understand them better. For now it has only few sorting alghoritms but I plan to add many more various alghoritms.

## Requirements
React, jquery, react-router-dom

## How to start your adventure with this app?
Just write npm run start in the console.
